### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer specializing in Rust, Python, C#, JavaScript, Android, Kotlin, and a bit of Unity game dev. My skillset includes making Android apps, systems programming with Rust*, SQLite database (Android Room for example), game dev using Unity (and a bit of 3d modeling thrown in there), Qt (especially PyQt), JNI / Kotlin, HTML+CSS+Javascript.
